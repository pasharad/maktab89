## Introduction

The Metro project is designed for my practice as mini-project.

## Features

- Train scheduling
- Ticket management
- User management
- Admin management
- And more!

## Usage

- To use the Metro project, simply follow the installation instructions below.
- After the cloning you can run main.py
- Atfirst you need create a user and an admin.
- Making user is easy but for create admin you need login with this admin_id: 0cc0a947-bd91-4228-b7b0-0fb39944a90c
- Then you can register new admin for manage your metro system.
- Note: after the registration, system gives a unique id for login into system so you should store it!!
- Well! you created one admin and one user
- If you login with user, you routed into user menu then you can bank_account management and more!!
- For bank_management you need unique bank id that system give you if you forgot that you can enter 5 at user menu and see user info. bank id is there.
- For buy ticket admin must create some ticket, if not user can not buy ticket!
- Admin can ban user by user id so take care :)
